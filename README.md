# KeyLoggerX

## Description
**KeyLoggerX** is a keystroke monitoring tool written in Python using the `pynput` library. This project demonstrates how to record and log keystrokes in real-time on both Windows and Linux operating systems. With its simple interface and organized logging, **KeyLoggerX** serves as a useful tool for security testing and understanding user behavior.

## Key Features
- **Keystroke Logging**: Captures every keystroke and saves it to a log file with timestamps.
- **Special Key Capture**: Identifies and logs special keys such as `Shift`, `Ctrl`, and `Alt`.
- **User-Friendly**: Simply run the program, and the keylogger will begin recording automatically.
- **Separate Log Files**: Each logging session is stored in a separate log file, making it easy to track and manage results.
